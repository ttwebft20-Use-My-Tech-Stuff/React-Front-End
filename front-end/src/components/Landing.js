                We know that feeling of unpacking something new. That's why
                we're keeping the excitement of discovery at the heart of every
                order, while taking care of any boring setup or cabling that may
                be necessary. Just plug it in and you're good to go. Trying
                something new has never been easier.

              <p>
                We know that accidents sometimes happen. All products rented
                from us are covered from accidental damage, including damage
                caused by liquids (just in case you spill a drink over it). The
                only thing we ask is that you treat the rented product as if it
                was your own. They are rare finds, and makers put their hearts
                and souls into bringing them to life.

                When time comes, just put it back in the box and give it to our
                courier. If you feel like buying the product, inventors usually
                include offers to purchase a brand new one and make it your own.

              <p>
                It's always better to experience a product. Show stores are
                great, but they're never as comfortable as home. With Wonder,
                customers can try your product exactly how they would if they
                purchased it.

                Trying new things with Us is beautifully easy, simple and
                inspirational. Every product comes pre-configured and ready to
                try - just plug and play. We are completely transparent, so you
                know exactly what youâ€™re paying for.
